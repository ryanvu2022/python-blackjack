A real blackjack game with rules:

- The deck is unlimited in size with no jokers.  
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10. The Ace can count as 11 or 1.  
- The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn and cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.  
  
- If the computer or the user has a blackjack or if the user's score is over 21, then the game ends.  
- The user can only see the computer's first card. Then the user will have a chance to draw another card until they choose to stop.  
- Once the user is done, it's time to let the computer play. The computer should keep drawing cards as long as it has a score less than 17.  
- If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack, then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack, then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.
